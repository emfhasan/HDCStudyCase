# HDCStudyCase
In  this  paper  we  studied  both  HD  and  CNN  for  populardata set and compare the 2-approaches in terms of accuracy, computing  complexity  and  overall  performance.  We  opti-mized  both  HDC  and  CNN  approaches  independently  and then analyzed the results to guide for the selection based on target need. 
 MNIST dataset was used in this work for HDC-based classification. The code is inspired and modefied from the paper " Binary-Hyperdimensional-Computing-Trade-offs-in-Choice-of-Density-and-Mapping" to match the targeted application. 
 
 The folder HDC contains the main MNIST_encoding.mat, whih are the main program to simulate with all required dataset and functions. For the execution, uncomment the required vector dimention and the determine the item memory seeds. 
 
 The folde CNN, has the CNN model which used for this study.
